A Letter From the President and CEO, Frank Ingersoll

As a consultant to high net worth investors, it is my fiduciary responsibility to make sure you are receiving sound wisdom and education as the foundation for managing your wealth.  This means understanding the true meaning of risk diversification when it comes to the Eagle Ford.  I am not just talking about diversification among various asset classes in the traditional sense.  The most critical aspect that many don't yet understand is that to be truly diversified is to build protection against the two biggest enemies of wealth building, inflation and taxes. 

My desire is to help you build a defensive portfolio against these elements to grow your wealth through the incredible benefits allocated to oil and gas drilling interests.  I have developed this website to further help you understand how the game has changed from the old wildcatting days of vertical drilling.  You will see how horizontal drilling has transformed the Eagle Ford into a low risk investment that can dramatically improve portfolio performance.  Please enjoy the content and feel free to contact me for more information. 



Sincerely,

 

Frank (Sandy) Ingersoll
