Frank Ingersoll--President

Frank (Sandy) Ingersoll has over 40 years of professional investment experience. He began his career on Wall Street as a portfolio analyst and quickly rose through the ranks to join the investment banking team at Oppenheimer.  After ten years in New York, Sandy exercised his entrepreneurial spirit by starting his own boutique firm in San Antonio, KRI Growth Stocks.  KRI specialized in financing early stage, high growth technology companies. KRI helped to spawn dozens of successful companies including U.S. Long Distance, which became the fasting growing zero plus dialing company in the country and was eventually purchased by Qwest Communications.  In 1995, Sandy retired from the investment business to pursue his love for writing. 

Over the past five years, recent innovations in horizontal fracking have created enormous opportunities for investment.  The Eagle Ford Shale has transformed South Texas into an oil and gas powerhouse on the international front.  In response, Sandy came out of retirement in 2012 to create SRI Diversified Capital.  At SRI, Sandy is able to leverage his considerable investment banking experience to consult independent drillers in project financing.  SRI also uses its strategic partnerships to invest with and advise other accredited investors in prime Eagle Ford developments.  Sandy is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley.
